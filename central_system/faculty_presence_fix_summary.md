# Faculty Presence Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Identified ‚úÖ

The faculty presence detection system was not working because of **multiple conflicting MQTT subscriptions** and **missing topic subscriptions**. The issues were:

### 1. MQTT Handler Conflicts
- The `AsyncMQTTService` was only storing **one handler per topic** instead of supporting multiple handlers
- When both `FacultyController` and `DashboardWindow` subscribed to the same topic, the last one would overwrite the first
- This caused faculty status updates to only reach the dashboard but not the faculty controller

### 2. Missing MAC Status Subscription  
- The `FacultyController` was handling `/mac_status` topics in the code but **not subscribing** to them
- ESP32 units publish to `consultease/faculty/{id}/mac_status` for BLE beacon detection
- These messages were not being processed by the faculty controller

## Fixes Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. Fixed AsyncMQTTService to Support Multiple Handlers

**File:** `central_system/services/async_mqtt_service.py`

- Changed `message_handlers` from `Dict[str, Callable]` to `defaultdict(list)` 
- Added thread-safe handler registration with locks
- Modified `register_topic_handler()` to append handlers instead of overwriting
- Updated `_on_message()` to call all matching handlers
- Enhanced logging to show handler names and counts

### 2. Added MAC Status Topic Subscription

**File:** `central_system/controllers/faculty_controller.py`

- Added subscription to `consultease/faculty/+/mac_status` in the `start()` method
- This enables the faculty controller to receive BLE beacon status from ESP32 units

### 3. Enhanced Debugging and Logging

- Added detailed handler execution logging
- Better topic matching diagnostics
- Handler registration counts for troubleshooting

## Testing Instructions üß™

### On the Raspberry Pi

1. **Start the ConsultEase system:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ConsultEase\ Final\ Code
   python3 central_system/main.py
   ```

2. **Check MQTT handler registration in logs:**
   Look for these log messages during startup:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Registered handler for topic 'consultease/faculty/+/status' (total handlers for this topic: 1)
   ‚úÖ Registered handler for topic 'consultease/faculty/+/mac_status' (total handlers for this topic: 1)
   ‚úÖ Registered handler for topic 'consultease/faculty/+/status' (total handlers for this topic: 2)
   ```

3. **Test with MQTT messages:**
   ```bash
   # Test regular status update
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "consultease/faculty/1/status" \
     -m '{"faculty_id": 1, "status": "AVAILABLE", "present": true, "timestamp": 1733467200}'

   # Test MAC status update (from ESP32)
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "consultease/faculty/1/mac_status" \
     -m '{"status": "faculty_present", "mac": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff", "timestamp": 1733467200}'

   # Test legacy status
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "professor/status" -m "keychain_connected"
   ```

4. **Verify in logs:**
   Look for these messages:
   ```
   Found 2 handlers for topic consultease/faculty/1/status
   Executing handler 'handle_faculty_status_update' for topic 'consultease/faculty/1/status'
   Executing handler 'handle_realtime_status_update' for topic 'consultease/faculty/1/status'
   üîÑ MQTT STATUS UPDATE - Topic: consultease/faculty/1/mac_status, Data: {...}
   ```

### Expected Behavior ‚úÖ

1. **Faculty Controller** should receive and process all status updates
2. **Dashboard Window** should receive real-time updates and display them
3. **Database** should be updated with faculty status changes
4. **BLE MAC addresses** should be automatically updated when detected
5. **Multiple handlers** should execute for the same MQTT topic

## Previous Problems Solved ‚úÖ

- ‚ùå **Faculty status not updating in database** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Fixed with multiple handlers
- ‚ùå **Dashboard not showing real-time updates** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Both handlers now work
- ‚ùå **ESP32 MAC status ignored** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Added subscription to mac_status topics
- ‚ùå **Handler conflicts overwriting each other** ‚Üí ‚úÖ AsyncMQTTService now supports multiple handlers
- ‚ùå **Threading crashes during MQTT handling** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Already fixed in previous updates

## Files Modified üìù

1. `central_system/services/async_mqtt_service.py` - Multiple handler support
2. `central_system/controllers/faculty_controller.py` - Added mac_status subscription
3. `central_system/test_faculty_presence.py` - Test script for verification

## Verification Commands üîç

```bash
# Check if handlers are properly registered
grep -r "Registered handler" /var/log/consultease/ | tail -10

# Monitor MQTT traffic
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "consultease/faculty/+/status"
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "consultease/faculty/+/mac_status"

# Check database updates
sqlite3 /path/to/consultease.db "SELECT name, status, last_seen FROM faculty ORDER BY last_seen DESC;"
```

The faculty presence detection should now work correctly with both ESP32 BLE beacon detection and manual status updates! üéâ
