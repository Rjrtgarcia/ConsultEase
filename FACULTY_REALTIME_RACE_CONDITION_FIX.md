# Faculty Real-Time Update Race Condition Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

The faculty cards in the dashboard were not updating in real-time despite receiving MQTT messages correctly. Analysis of the logs revealed a **race condition** between:

1. **Real-time MQTT updates** - Faculty Controller receives ESP32 status and publishes to dashboard
2. **Database refreshes** - Dashboard loads faculty data from database immediately after
3. **UI initialization** - Dashboard triggers initial faculty load during window show

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### Timeline from Logs:
```
06:50:47,677 - Dashboard receives MQTT: {'status': True, 'faculty_id': 1}
06:50:47,679 - Dashboard receives MQTT: {'status': True, 'faculty_id': 2}  
06:50:47,713 - Faculty card shows: status: offline → #9E9E9E (grey)
06:50:47,821 - Dashboard triggers initial faculty load
06:50:48,056 - Faculty card shows: status: Unavailable → #9E9E9E (grey)
```

### The Race Condition:
1. **ESP32 sends status**: `AVAILABLE` → Faculty Controller
2. **Faculty Controller**: Receives → Updates Database → Publishes MQTT
3. **Dashboard**: Receives MQTT → Processes update → **BUT...**
4. **Database commit not yet complete** when dashboard processes the MQTT message
5. **Dashboard initialization**: Triggers immediate database refresh with stale data
6. **Result**: Real-time update overridden by stale database data

### Additional Issues Found:
- ✅ Dashboard `show_consultation_form()` was creating new `FacultyController()` instead of using global instance
- ✅ Multiple MQTT handlers (`handle_realtime_status_update` + `handle_system_notification`) processing same message
- ✅ No throttling between UI refreshes allowing rapid overrides

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Race Condition Protection**
- Added **500ms delay** to real-time status updates before UI processing
- Added **750ms delay** to system notifications (secondary to direct updates)
- Added **1000ms delay** to initial faculty load on dashboard show

### 2. **Fixed Faculty Controller Usage**
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong - creates new instance)
from ..controllers import FacultyController
fc = FacultyController()

# AFTER (Fixed - uses global instance)
from ..controllers.faculty_controller import get_faculty_controller
fc = get_faculty_controller()
```

### 3. **UI Refresh Throttling**
- Added `refresh_faculty_status_throttled()` with minimum 2-second interval
- Connected `request_ui_refresh.emit()` to throttled version
- Prevents rapid refreshes from overriding real-time updates

### 4. **Delayed Processing Architecture**
```python
def _process_status_update_safe(self, data):
    # Parse MQTT data
    faculty_id = data.get('faculty_id')
    new_status = data.get('status')
    
    # 🔧 FIX: Delay UI update to allow database commit
    def delayed_update():
        card_updated = self.update_faculty_card_status(faculty_id, new_status)
        if not card_updated:
            self.request_ui_refresh.emit()  # Throttled refresh
    
    QTimer.singleShot(500, delayed_update)  # 500ms delay
```

## 📊 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### Real-Time Update Flow:
1. **ESP32** → `AVAILABLE` status
2. **Faculty Controller** → Receives ESP32 message
3. **Database Update** → Controller updates status in DB (with retry logic)
4. **MQTT Publish** → Controller publishes to dashboard topics
5. **Dashboard Receives** → MQTT message processed
6. **500ms Delay** → Wait for database commit to complete
7. **UI Update** → Faculty card updated to "Available"
8. **No Override** → Throttled refreshes prevent stale data loading

### Timing Protection:
- **Direct Status Updates**: 500ms delay
- **System Notifications**: 750ms delay (secondary)
- **Initial Faculty Load**: 1000ms delay (on dashboard show)
- **Refresh Throttling**: Minimum 2-second interval between full refreshes

## 🧪 **Testing Verification**

### Manual Test Steps:
1. Start ConsultEase system on Raspberry Pi
2. ESP32 desk unit changes from AWAY → AVAILABLE
3. **Expected Result**: Faculty card should update from "Unavailable" → "Available" within 3-5 seconds
4. **No manual refresh required**

### Log Verification:
Look for these success indicators:
```
✅ [UI SUCCESS] Faculty card for ID {faculty_id} updated in place, no full refresh needed
🔄 [THROTTLE] Proceeding with throttled refresh - {time}s since last refresh
⏱️ [THROTTLE] Skipping refresh - only {time}s since last refresh
```

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. **`central_system/views/dashboard_window.py`**:
   - Fixed `show_consultation_form()` to use global Faculty Controller
   - Added race condition delays to MQTT handlers
   - Added UI refresh throttling
   - Delayed initial faculty load on window show

2. **Previous fixes maintained**:
   - Global Faculty Controller pattern in `faculty_controller.py`
   - Dashboard using global controller in `main.py`

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

✅ **Real-time updates work without manual refresh**  
✅ **Faculty cards update within 3-5 seconds of ESP32 status change**  
✅ **No race conditions between MQTT and database refreshes**  
✅ **System remains stable under rapid status changes**  
✅ **Dashboard initialization doesn't override real-time updates**

## 📝 **Notes**

- This fix addresses timing issues rather than fundamental architecture problems
- The delays are conservative to ensure reliability across different hardware
- Throttling protects against UI spam while maintaining responsiveness
- Global Faculty Controller pattern ensures single source of truth
